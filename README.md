# React Hooks Deep Dive üöÄ


Welcome to the **React Hooks Deep Dive** repository! This repository accompanies a complete course on mastering React Hooks, equipping developers with essential tools for handling component logic, side effects, and state management in React applications. Each hook is covered with examples that illustrate both **basic use cases** and **advanced techniques**.

#### If you need to learn these topics, check [**React Hooks**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS-MrzRLZtmco6NZKRthlaWDCHcrdMlhg).

## üìö Hooks Covered

This course includes in-depth examples of the following hooks:

1. **useCallback**
2. **useContext**
3. **useDeferredValue**
4. **useImperativeHandle**
5. **useLayoutEffect**
6. **useEffect**
7. **useMemo**
8. **useRef**
9. **useState**
10. **useSyncExternalStore**
11. **useTransition**

Each hook has its own dedicated folder with examples and best practices.

## üìë How to Use This Repository

Each hook folder contains:

- A **README.md** that introduces the hook, explaining its purpose, usage, and use cases.
- **Code examples** that show the hook in action with "basic" and "advanced" scenarios.
- Explanations of common pitfalls and how to avoid them, as well as tips for getting the most out of each hook.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced React developer, these examples aim to make your code more **efficient**, **cleaner**, and easier to understand.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the examples locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-hooks-deep-dive.git
   cd react-hooks-deep-dive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Each hook example is self-contained, making it easy to explore specific use cases independently.

## üîç Hooks Overview

Here‚Äôs a quick summary of each hook and what it‚Äôs designed for:

- **useCallback**: Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders, particularly useful for passing stable callbacks to child components.
- **useContext**: Accesses global state without prop drilling, perfect for managing data across deeply nested components.
- **useDeferredValue**: Defers updates for less urgent renders, helping manage responsiveness in high-priority rendering situations.
- **useImperativeHandle**: Customizes the instance value exposed by `ref` in parent components, useful for managing imperative interactions.
- **useLayoutEffect**: Fires synchronously after all DOM mutations, ideal for measurements and DOM adjustments before the browser paints.
- **useEffect**: Manages side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and direct DOM updates.
- **useMemo**: Caches expensive calculations to optimize performance and avoid recalculations on every render.
- **useRef**: Creates a mutable reference to a DOM element or value, persisting across renders without causing re-renders.
- **useState**: Manages local component state, providing a straightforward way to keep track of values within components.
- **useSyncExternalStore**: Syncs React state with an external store, keeping the UI consistent with changes from outside sources.
- **useTransition**: Allows for deferred state updates, helpful in managing transitions and keeping the UI responsive during slow updates.
